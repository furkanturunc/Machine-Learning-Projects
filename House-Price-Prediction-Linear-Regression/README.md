### Description:
- This project aims to predict house prices from the given input features such as number of bedrooms or sqft living. 
- Dataset extracted from Kaggle: [harlfoxem/housesalesprediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- It uses linear regression model.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Applying linear algebra and gradient descent knowledge by building linear regression model from sctratch (w/o using a built-in function)
- Feature engineering (feature selection, feature transformation)
